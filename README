sxpath is a Shitty Xpath alike for embedded systems or, more widely, for
any UNIX-like systems. It compiles under Cygwin too.

Originally written for execution on the Popcorn Hour, where it was
impractical to acquire lots of dependencies for proper XML parsing, this is
a hack to bring easy scraping to embedded systems.

The general idea is to provide a "path" like /xml/foo/bar which, given input
such as:
<xml>
        <foo>
                <bar>1</bar>
                <bar>2</bar>
        </foo>
        <foo>
                <bar>3</bar>
                <bar>4</bar>
        </foo>
</xml>

would give output of:
/xml/foo/bar: 1
/xml/foo/bar: 2
/xml/foo/bar: 3
/xml/foo/bar: 4

i.e. easily parseable line-based output for the UNIX swiss-army-knife
utility collection, e.g. awk, grep, sed, etc.

Actually, the largest and messiest part of the code is dedicated to HTML
scraping ("lax" mode) to make it possible to write applications around
scraping content from the web.

To compile;

gcc -Wall -Os -o sxpath sxpath.c

For runtime help just execute the program with parameters.
